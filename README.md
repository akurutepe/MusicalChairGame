# MusicalChairGame
Concurrent Programming

Kids are bored in the kindergarten and the intern preschool teacher offers playing musical chairs game.
The game starts with N students and N-1 chairs. 
The teacher starts the music and the students walk around the chairs. 
As soon as the teacher stops the music the students sit on chairs and one who cannot get a chair is eliminated at that round. 
Then the teacher moves one chair away and the game continues in this fashion until one student wins the game. 
After the game finishes, the teacher asks the students how they did in the game. 
A schematic model for the game is shown in schematic.png.
